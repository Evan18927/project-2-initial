# Reflections Log

This document serves as a log of reflections on various topics, capturing insights, lessons learned, and personal growth. It is intended to help users track their thoughts and experiences over time.


All I used for AI was claude. It by far exceeded my expectations, It did everything with almost no problems I cant even think of 1 problem at the moment with it, So I cant even say what it struggled on in this assignment.

I believe that the AI coding is even better then most people at our class level of coding by far and esspecially it is faster than any human at the speed it writes the code and it is also much more vercatile.

I learned about how AI holds on to our conversation sometimes I would ask like where is this menu at or re write it or something along those lines and it would still be connected to all the previous questions and code pictures ive submitted and such as long as I was in the same window.

I tested it on IntelliJ, I double checked with Claude, and I did a run through to make sure there was no extra brackets as well as other things to check.

I will use AI tools to allow it to help me in the very repetitive pieces of coding for sure and as well as if I get stuck its like another person there to look at it with me and come up with ideas of why I have errors.
